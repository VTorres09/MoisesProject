# Chord Detection Algorithm
A chord detection system that aims to detect the chord sequence in a song and its respective playing times, this project was created for the Moises
Chord Detection Challenge, based on Decibelâ€™s Algorithm, using Spotify Web API, Cifraclub website, Youtube features and focus on crowdsourcing.

# Running the Code
The first step to run the algorithm is to have a Data folder (you can contact me) to train the decibel properly. Also, you have to download the chromedriver and put inside this folder.
After that, you have to change the decibel/import_export/datapath.txt to your Data folder path. Finally, you can run the app.py (confirm that all libraries have been downloaded before).
